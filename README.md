# My Art Website

## This was a project to get practice working with HTML and CSS and where I could host my artwork.

### Technology Used:
HTML, CSS, Visual Studio Code, Git, Terminal


### Challenges:
1. My initial challege was having the navigation menu on the left side of the webpage in a fixed position.

### What I loved:
1. I love the colors of this design and how fun the page is.
2. I think this is a fun way for artists and illustrators to display their work.

### Future Ideas:
1. I would like the artwork to all be the exact same height as I think that would improve the design.
